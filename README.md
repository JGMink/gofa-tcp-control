*AI-Based Natural Language to Robot Gestures in Real Time*

**Team Members:** Christian Lemma, Joseph Lin, Thomas Marshall, Jonah Minkoff

**Summary:**  
Words2Motion explores intuitive human–robot interaction by letting users control an **ABB GoFa** robot purely through natural spoken language. Building on prior work from **Magnaforma**, **Echo**, and **Proximitry©**, the system captures free-form verbal commands (e.g., “give a slow welcoming wave to the left, then point at the table”), interprets intent with a large language model, and converts it into real-time, smooth, collision-safe robot gestures. Rather than relying on fixed routines, Words2Motion dynamically interprets meaning, allowing users to iteratively refine motions with follow-up instructions.
