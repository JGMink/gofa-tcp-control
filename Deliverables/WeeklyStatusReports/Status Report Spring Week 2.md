## Weekly Task Assignments & Achievements

| **Team Member** | **Assigned Task(s)** | **Progress / Achievements This Week** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **All Members** | Each person worked on their own part refining and connecting to the next step of the pipeline. |
| **Joseph** | Expo scene creation and props | Continued to work and research on unity expo scene. Connected with Dr. Brixey and finalized the 3d printed props. |
| **Jonah** | LLM and Machine learning | Continued working on the completion and integration of the Speech-to-Text and Unity action execution as well as Unity to Robot proper command translation/execution. |
| **Thomas** | RobotStudio Improvement | Continued working on the robotstudio model and finding student rate licensing. Provided video of robot moving smoothly with virtual control. |
| **Christian** | CLU and Parsing | Continued to improve the CLU's ability to understand unspecified follow up instructions. Altered the direction orientation to ensure it is natural to the user. |

## Challenges / Issues Faced
Finding cost effective licensing for RobotStudio that will last longer than student free trails.  
Fixing robot direction orientation as well as command understanding. Robot either doesn't listen of double executes a single instruction.  
Finding the right duration of silence expected before robot executes without latency but without inaccuracy.

## Plans for Next Week
- **All Members:** Continue refining individual sections and creating a cohesive connection between each part.  
- **Thomas:** Work on finalizing Unity model and Robot Studio connection and functionality. 
- **Joseph:** Create the expo scene and the working table measurements and continue working with Dr. Brixey on preparing the 3d props. 
- **Jonah:** Work on the code-to-unity measurement difference and fine tuning the command execution function.  
- **Christian:** Add prompting components and make the text to speech more interactive/conversational. Add menus for the user to base commands off of.
