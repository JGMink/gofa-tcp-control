## Weekly Task Assignments & Achievements  
Each member researched the following:

| **Team Member** | **Assigned Task(s)** | **Progress / Achievements This Week** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Thomas** | Unity Research | Explored programming collaborative robots (cobots) by voice using ROSGPT*. Reviewed research on interpretable robot control via structured behavior trees and large language models (LLMs). |
| **Jonah** | Unity Research | Investigated programming cobots by voice using ROSGPT*. Studied interpretable robot control through structured behavior trees and LLMs for natural language motion control. |
| **Christian** | Testing Research | Studied testing metrics for evaluating the project, such as motion quality, robustness, and text-to-motion alignment. Prepared potential datasets for testing specific functionalities. |
| **Joseph** | Control Stack | Researched the interplay between high-level language instructions with vision policies and low-level conditioned instruction execution. |
