## Weekly Task Assignments & Achievements

| **Team Member** | **Assigned Task(s)** | **Progress / Achievements This Week** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **All Members** | Research & Idea Development | Continued brainstorming and recording implementation ideas. Met to discuss and evaluate different approaches for the Expo demo. Worked on improving and refining initial concepts. |
| **Joseph** | Robot Introduction | Had initial hands-on introduction session with the doctoral student, learning basic robot connection procedures and safety protocols. Began familiarizing with the robot interface. |
| **Jonah** | AI Model Research | Continued researching and compiling experiment ouline for evaluating different AI models for text-to-code generation. Improved data pipeline. Completed weekly status report. |
| **Thomas** | Unity Setup & Exploration | Set up Unity development environment and began exploring basic robot modeling approaches. Researched how to import and configure 3D models in Unity. |
| **Christian** | TTS Analysis | Continued comparative analysis of text-to-speech services, documenting cost structures, token usage rates, and performance characteristics across different platforms. |

## Challenges / Issues Faced
Learning curve for robot connection procedures and understanding safety requirements was steeper than expected.  
Evaluating AI models without hands-on testing made it difficult to assess real-world performance.  
Unity modeling proved more complex than initially anticipated.
