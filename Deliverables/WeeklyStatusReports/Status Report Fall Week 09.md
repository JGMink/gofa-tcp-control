## Weekly Task Assignments & Achievements

| **Team Member** | **Assigned Task(s)** | **Progress / Achievements This Week** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **All Members** | Project Development & Expo Prep | Developed 2–3 concrete competitive examples for the Expo demo. Ensured Unity was installed and tested across all members. Pulled in ABB GoFa robot code for Unity simulation and began initial exploration. Continued investigating Whisper and started building early prototypes. Reviewed RAPID and ROS learning materials shared by Dr. Nadeem. Scheduled lab time for hands-on testing with the GoFa robot. |
| **Joseph** | Unity & Research | Researched further ideas for the demo and began working within Unity to prototype interactions. Started exploring prior related projects and codebases. |
| **Jonah** | Concept Development & Coordination | Led team discussion to finalize and refine demo ideas. Worked on utilizing the ABB model in Unity. Continued developing the guiding framework for idea design and long-term goals. |
| **Thomas** | Unity Model & Whisper Refinement | Uploaded and configured the ABB GoFa Unity model. Worked on refining the Whisper implementation approach and identifying integration methods for speech processing. |
| **Christian** | Whisper Development & Concept Design | Collaborated with Thomas to develop the Whisper-based speech-to-text approach. Contributed 1–2 fleshed-out demo ideas to the group’s design pool. |

## Challenges / Issues Faced
Integrating the ABB robot model into Unity presented some technical setup difficulties.  
Coordinating Whisper installation and early code testing across different systems required troubleshooting and dependency alignment.

## Plans for the Next Two Weeks
- **Christian:** Build Whisper speech-to-text system.  
- **Jonah:** Develop a working prototype for converting text into intent maps.  
- **Thomas:** Learn and run basic scripts with the robot Unity model.  
- **Joseph:** Contact Noor to plan for physical robot exploration and get access to previous project code.  
- **All Members:**  
  - Ensure collaborative Unity project files are shared and synced.  
  - Get Unity, ROS, and all required tech running smoothly.  
  - Determine final Expo demo concept.  
  - Update weekly reports (Jonah, Christian).  
  - Find standard RAPID resources and continue learning the language fundamentals.
