## Challenges / Issues Faced
Coordinating the final revisions of the proposal while dividing research tasks between Unity and ROS proved time-consuming.  
Ensuring that each member’s research direction remained aligned with the overall project goals required additional coordination.

## Plans for Next Week
- Submit the finalized proposal and confirm advisor approval.  
- Begin setting up the initial Unity and ROS environments for testing.  
- Start defining the data flow and communication pipeline between speech input, intent parsing, and robot motion execution.
