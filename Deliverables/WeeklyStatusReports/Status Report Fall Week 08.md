## Weekly Task Assignments & Achievements

| **Team Member** | **Assigned Task(s)** | **Progress / Achievements This Week** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **All Members** | Research & Tool Selection | Conducted focused research to finalize the speech-to-text tool decision. The team agreed to proceed with **Whisper** for its open-source accessibility and strong offline performance. |
| **Joseph** | Related Research & Unity Setup | Researched related academic papers and projects for inspiration and implementation strategies. Successfully installed and configured Unity for early development testing. |
| **Jonah** | Project Direction & Documentation | Met with the professor to discuss ideas and guiding principles for the project. Developed a **Guiding Expo Principles** document to clarify long-term goals and presentation direction. |
| **Thomas** | Whisper Implementation Research | Investigated Whisper’s installation process and API integration options. Worked with Christian to plan early implementation steps. |
| **Christian** | Whisper Implementation Research | Assisted Thomas in researching Whisper setup and exploring Python-based methods for speech-to-text integration. |

## Challenges / Issues Faced
Minor challenges in coordinating research efforts across Unity, ROS, and Whisper.  
Ensuring all team members had compatible environments for tool testing took additional time.

---

## Plans for Next Week
- Develop **2–3 concrete competitive examples** for the Expo demo.  
- Ensure everyone has Unity installed and has tested a demo project.  
- Pull in **ABB GoFa robot code** for the Unity simulation and begin exploring its integration.  
- Continue experimenting with **Whisper** and begin coding early STT solutions.  
- Find solid **RAPID** and **ROS** learning resources and start training (each member to review Dr. Nadeem’s shared materials).  
- Schedule **lab time** to get hands-on with the GoFa robot and review the accompanying setup manual.
