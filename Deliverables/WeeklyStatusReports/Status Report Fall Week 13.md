## Weekly Task Assignments & Achievements

| **Team Member** | **Assigned Task(s)** | **Progress / Achievements This Week** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **All Members** | Expo Idea Finalization | Met as a team to finalize the Expo demo concept after weeks of brainstorming and evaluation. Agreed on the specific implementation approach and scope for the demonstration. |
| **Joseph** | Robot Training Continuation | Continued hands-on learning with the robot, practicing connection and basic control procedures. Worked on understanding robot movement capabilities and limitations. |
| **Jonah** | AI Analysis Drafting | Drafted initial AI analysis walkthrough documenting experimentation approach for evaluating different models. Outlined methodology for comparing AI model performance on text-to-code tasks. Completed weekly status report. |
| **Thomas** | Unity Model Development | Continued working on the Unity robot model, making progress on basic structure and configuration. Researched how to accurately represent robot movements in simulation and where to update robot scripting. |
| **Christian** | TTS Prototype Development | Made progress on developing initial text-to-speech system prototype. Continued refining understanding of different implementation approaches based on ongoing research. |
