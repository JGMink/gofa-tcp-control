## Challenges / Issues Faced
Compiling research poster while still developing core system components required presenting work-in-progress effectively.  
Coordinating full team robot training session around everyone's schedules was challenging.  
Balancing time between poster development and ongoing technical work required careful prioritization.  
Short week due to upcoming Thanksgiving break compressed available working time.
