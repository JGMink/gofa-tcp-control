## Weekly Task Assignments & Achievements

| **Team Member** | **Assigned Task(s)** | **Progress / Achievements This Week** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **All Members** | Refine Robot Communication | Each person worked on their own part refining and connecting to the next step of the pipeline. |
| **Joseph** | Expo scene modeling and props | Continued making good progress in modeling out the scene and getting details on the props to go hand in hand with the gripper measurements.  |
| **Jonah** | Setting up Gripper Model and Functionality | Worked on errors when setting up the gripper model in unity. Worked on completing the LLM instruction set and is continuing to work on implementing gripper instructions. Met with VIP students and discussed the full pipeline and strategies for project structuring. |
| **Thomas** | Setting up bounding Box in RobotStudio | Finished setting up the boundary box in RobotStudio with SafeMove. Working on finding out the exact size desired for the bounding space. Planning on configuring SafeMove and the physical robot.  |
| **Christian** | Unity Transition | Transitioning to the Unity side of the pipeline. Researched ways to control the speed of motion (acceleration and deceleration) when robot executes commands. |

## Plans for Next Week
- **All Members:** Continue refining individual sections and creating a cohesive connection between each part.  
- **Thomas:** Choosing the best configuration options with SafeMove that is most beneficial with the chosen use case. Designing the bounding box to be a semispherical shape to allow the robot's full span movements.  
- **Joseph:** Continue working on modeling the assembly zone. 
- **Jonah:** Continue working on refining the gripper modeling and functionalities.  
- **Christian:** Work on follow up commands that allow control of the speed at which the robot executes a command.
